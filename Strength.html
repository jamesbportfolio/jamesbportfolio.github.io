  <title>Strength, Stretch, SMART Goal</title>
  <body class="academics">
    <h2> Strength</h2>
    <p>My strength was working independently. It has remained constant in my essays, math tests, and Spanish tests. I think I could be more confident going into assessments by focusing more on the homework. </p>
    <h2>Stretch</h2>
    <p>My stretch was working on group projects. I feel it is becoming more of a strength, because I worked well with my partner and got a good grade on the Spanish doctor project and the Constitutional convention project. However, I can still work on acknowledging and including opinions I disagree with in projects.</p>
    <h2> SMART Goal</h2>
    <p>My SMART Goal is to be more confident going into essays and improve my writing. This year, I studied and made detailed thinking maps before each essay and asked the teacher clarifying questions to make sure I understood the prompt. I also made sure to have a strong thesis to support my essays. This year, I can improve by finding a better balance between analysis and evidence.</p>
